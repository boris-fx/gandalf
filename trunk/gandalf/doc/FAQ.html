<br><br>

You will need an ANSI/ISO C compiler. For Unix systems you will need Gnu
libtool to be installed on your system. If PNG, JPEG and TIFF image format
I/O libraries are installed, Gandalf will find and use them through use of
the Gnu "configure" script (under Windows these features need to be specified
manually; see the gandalf/INSTALL file). The LAPACK linear algebra library
will also be used if available, although there are internal substitutes
for most of the LAPACK functions used by Gandalf. To use the display features
you will also need OpenGL to be installed with the GLUT toolkit.

Gandalf has been compiled and tested on Linux (PC), IRIX 6.5, Solaris and
MSVC 6. It has also been cross-compiled on a Power PC. Basically any system
with an ANSI/ISO C compiler should be OK.

<br><br>

A common misunderstanding for people who haven't programmed in an event-driven
environment is to forget to include a glutMainLoop() call, which passes
control to the GLUT event handler. When you create a window using
gan_display_new_window(), gan_display_new_window_array() or
gan_image_display_new_window(), you need to specify
callbacks using glutDisplayFunc() so that the windows will be updated
when an event involving the window is processed.
See gandalf/image/bitmap_test.c and gandalf/vision/vision_test.c for examples.

<br><br>

The usual problem here is a conflict between which libraries are actually
available and which libraries Gandalf thinks are available. This is especially
a problem under Windows where the libraries need to be specified manually.
Another possibility is that the installed libraries are old versions
with slightly different functions.
