Gandalf is a computer vision and numerical algorithm library, written in C,
which allows you to develop new applications that will be portable and run
FAST. Dynamically reconfigurable vector, matrix and image structures allow
efficient use of memory.

Gandalf has been used to develop the "mokey" motion editing software
by Imagineer Systems Ltd,
released at IBC'2001 in Amsterdam. Mokey performs automatic inpainting of
moving objects over an image sequence, and can also be used to compute
an accurate alpha matte or outline of an object.

Gandalf is free for use for both research and commercial purpises under the
LGPL (Lesser Gnu Public License). Gandalf been used on commercial
development contracts in the areas of

Gandalf currently contains four packages:
<ul>
 <li><b><a href="tutorial/report/node12.html">Common</a></b>
      package of simple structures
      and routines used by the other packages, such as memory
      allocation, linked lists and error handling;
 <li><b><a href="tutorial/report/node27.html">Linear algebra</a></b>
      package with a large number of
      routines for matrix and vector manipulations;
 <li><b><a href="tutorial/report/node84.html">Image</a></b>
      package defining a general purpose image
      structure and low-level image manipulation routines;
 <li><b><a href="tutorial/report/node101.html">Vision</a></b>
      package containing a number of standard image
      processing, computer vision and geometrical routines.
</ul>
The major design features of Gandalf are
<ol>
 <li>Efficient use of memory through dynamically reconfigurable structures;
 <li>Emphasis on support of numerical algorithms, especially optimisation;
 <li>A very flexible and efficient internal image representation,
 <li>A comprehensive set of matrix/vector operations, incorporating implicit
      matrix transpose & inverse, and in-place computation where appropriate;
 <li>Thread-safe.
 <li>Exploitation of the computational and compilation speed
      advantages of C over C++ in reducing the number of layers of
      abstraction over the raw data, an approach we believe is
      appropriate for simple objects such as matrices, vectors and
      images.

The documentation for Gandalf comes in two parts. There is a LaTex tutorial
with examples available in <a href="tutorial/report/index.html">HTML</a>
(via <a href="http://www.latex2html.org">Latex2html</a>) or as a
<a href="tutorial/report.pdf">PDF</a> file.
Reference documentation for Gandalf has also been generated using
<a href="http://www.doxygen.org/index.html">Doxygen</a>, and is
available <a href="reference/index.html">here</a>.

There is a Gandalf <a href="FAQ.html">FAQ</a>.
