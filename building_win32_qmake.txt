COMPILING AS A STATIC LIBRARY

1. Ensure that a statically-built version of Qt is available.

2. cd into the directory containing gandalf. This directory MUST be named
   "gandalf" and the DEVDIR environment variable must be set to point to the
   parent directory of the gandalf directory.

3. Copy the config_mscv7.h file to config.h

4. Run the Qmake command (substituting the correct QMake path):

   C:\Qt\4.4.3\bin\qmake.exe -tp vc gandalf.pro "CONFIG += staticlib" "DEFINES += GANDALF_STATIC"

5. Run VCBUILD to build the project itself:

   vcbuild gandalf.vcproj [Debug | Release]

NOTES

* You must have libtiff, libpng and libjpeg available to build Gandalf. Modify
  the .pro file if necessary to point to the include and library directories
  containing these libraries.

* If the library still attempts to build as a DLL, make sure that there is no
  "CONFIG += dll" or equivalent line in the .pro file.
